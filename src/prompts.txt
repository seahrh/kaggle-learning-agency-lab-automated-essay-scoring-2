[ESSAY]The author supports his arguement quite effectively, though not without any flaws. The author effectively lists off the benefits of exploring Venus, and proper proposals for doing so, however the complexity and unrealistic assumptions of the solutions as well as the negative descripton of Venus take away from its point rather than benefiting it.

The effective conveying of benefits helps to support its idea of risking danger for the reward of landing. The author describes how Venus is relatable with earth which creates a connection between the reader and Venus, as well as creating a mood of hospitality and familiarity. It also states that because Venus is the "nearest option for a planetary visit", it is a benefit to inhabit Venus first. This persuasion effectivly uses logos to show the audience logical reasoning for why the scientists should endevour to research Venus.

The author's proposals for ways to accomplish these tasks help to build ethos in the writing, as it shows that the author knows about the information that is displayed. The introduction of NASA also builds up this ethos, as to bring the audience to better trust in the author. The examples of proposals also provide evidence for how such ideas could be accomplished, such as the ideas of "systems that use mechanical parts" and therefore add to the logos of the paragraph, as the author logically explains why the proposals would be beneficial.

However in contrast with the effective support of the main idea, the author also convey's information and techniques that oppose his idea. Firstly, the author makes assumptions about how much technology would have advanced, and because his proposal for a "blimp-like vehicle" is so technologically advanced and seems outlansish, the mood created for the audience is incredulous and skeptical. This does not benefit the writer's ideas because of the audiences mood, and therefore the author loses the audiences trust in proper solutions.

Also negatively impacting the main idea are his descriptions of Venus. This is because the author uses a lot of evidence to support how dangerous Venus is, in direct contrast to what he should be supporting. Because of the logos used to show how dangerous Venus is, like how it has "temperatures average over 800 degrees" the audience is put into a mood of impossibility and doubt. Because of the mood of the audience, the audience is also less likely to understand why Venus could be beneficial if the landscape is so terribly trecherous.

In conclusion, the writer does a fairly effective job at expressing is ideas, in his building of ethos and pathos that help to support why Venus is so amazing, and how to explore it, however fails by accidently creating a mood of unbelievablity, and therefore losing the audience to the uncertain nature of the situation. If the author had attempted to create a mood that was more beneficial to persuading the audience, the passage would have been extremely effective in persuading the audience of his thesis. [/ESSAY]

[TITLE]Exploring Venus[/TITLE]
[ESSAY]Do you think that the Electoral College prosses is practical? Do you think that it is okay for someone else to vote for us? Well, I dont think that it is right, and there are some reasons I am about to tell you that may change your mind about the whole process of voteing and electing a president. Here are a few points I am going to cover in this essay about Electoral Colleges: over sixty percent of people do not agree with the electoral process, it it outdated and not accurate, also the electorers have proven to be untrustworthy in the past.

Most people dont really understand what the Electoral College is, or what it is about, so let me just inform you about it a little. The Electoral College is a process that was established in the constitution and it is a strategy that we use to elect out presidents. The citizens vote for the president, but so the the electors in the Electoral College. There are over five hundred members of the Electoral College, and if a canadate wants to win presidency, he/she has to gain 270 of the Electoral College's votes. Each person running has a set of their own electors. Many people believe that this should not be used as a way to elect a president because in the past, the Electoral Collage made Gore loose the presidental election because although he had more popular votes than Goerge Bush, he has less electoral votes. Some people argue that the Electoral College is trustworthy, but how are my fellow Americans expected to trust a group of people who have betrayed us before?

Another reason why I dont think that we should keep the Electoral College is because so many people disagree with it. Everyone has their own reason for not liking it, but sixty percent of American voters agree that we should not have it and we need to find a new system for electing presidents. Most people lost repect for the Electoral College after what happened with Bush and Gore, but many people think that it is old and outdated, and that it doesn't really make any snese to use it and that it is irrational. I'm not saying that just because a lot of people don't like something, that we should change it, I'm just explaining that if only fourty percent of the nation agrees with something, then maybe the majority should win! Some people might say that the Electoral College was put in the consitution and that we should keep using the process because we've had it for so long, but with time, things change, and just because we've used something for a long time, doesn't mean we shouldn't upgrade.

Don't you think that it is great to live in a free county where the citizens make the rules, and what is in the best interest of the people is what is taken into consideration more than what the government wants? Well, the Electoral College isn't what "we the people" want. We want to be able to choose who we elect, not another group of people. Some may argue that the electoral congress is good because if two canadates get the same amount of popular votes, the Electoral Congress acts as a tie breaker, but I'm sure that we can find a better way to break the tie than having untrustworthy people decide the fate of our homeland.

This is why I think that we should get rid of the Electoral Congress, too many people disagree with it, there are many flaws in the system and it is old and outdated. I hope that I have swayed your opinion and that you are part of the sixty percent of Americans who are hungry for change.    [/ESSAY]
