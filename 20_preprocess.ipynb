Using a phone while driving can cause very bad wrecks, because they are putting themselves and other people at risk. People should not be able to use cell phones while operating a vehicle is because bad wrecks, putting others' lives in danger, and may cause death. First of all, wrecks can be caused by looking down at your phone while driving. Most importantly, you should always keep your eyes directly on the road when behind the wheel of a car. On that note, you will have an outrageously car payment just because you were looking down at your phone. Moreover, if you the reason the accident happened the person that was operating the other car can sue you for lots of money, and you will have to pay it. Therefore, if you don't pay whatever the person charges you consequences will be served and that's behind bars. Another reason why we should not be able to use cell phones while operating an automobile is that you are putting other people's lives in danger. Thus, looking down at your cell phone you can get someone else hurt for the uncommunicative act you committed. As well as unconsciousness, injuries, or being in a hospital.

Especially new drivers, all driver for that matter do not understand the dangers of looking at a cell phone while behind the wheel. The automobile crashes due to distracted driving are increasing, teens have been the largest age group that was reported to being distracted by cellular usage. I do not agree with people using their cell phones and driving, humans should be smarter to know that if something is going on while they are driving that is so important then pulling off to the side of the road. The society doesn't understand that teens are the main cause for accidents I mean, in two thousand and five there was three hundred and one thousand injuries that were caused in distracted driving related accidents, that doesn't necessarily mean that the driver was texting or using a cellular device. New drivers do not understand that deaths are usually results of an accident. one out of every four car accidents is caused by texting and driving.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Phones &amp; Driving Drivers should not be able to use phones while operating a vehicle. Drivers who used their phone while operating a vehicle are most likely to get into an accident that could be fatal. According to an article by the Edgar Snyder Firm, 21% of teens that were part of a fatal car accident was due to phones. According to the same article, 35% know the risk but continue using their phones while on the road. This shows that its beyond dangerous and irresponsible of drivers not to be fully aware of their surroundings while driving. Drivers should be able to concentrate without any distractions, because it could be fatal. According to another article, \"Distracted Driving\" by the NHTSA, there has already been about 3,000 phone related car accident deaths since 2017. The article states that teen get too distracted with their phones, which causes their accident. Accidents that can be easily avoided by focusing on the road and not a phone. Drivers should not be able to use their phones at all while driving. In conclusion, drivers should not able to work a vehicle while using their cell phone. Drivers who uses their phones while operating a vehicle and are likely to have an accident then those who don't.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Cell Phone Operation While Driving The ability to stay connected to people we know despite distance was originally brought to fruition by the use of letters. This system was found to be rather slow and new pathways were searched for until the invention of the telegram; the people thought it was an invention of the millennia, but after time it too was thought of as slow until the invention of the telephone. Today, a telephone is in the hand or pocket of a majority of the seven billion people on planet earth. However, this device is taken to areas that it is irresponsible and dangerous. Within a vehicle capable of traveling upwards of one hundred miles per hour any possible distraction can become fatal spontaneously. The most common of these distractions is a cell phone, with its capabilities to connect us to anyone also in ownership of one, it is easy to pick it up whenever it sounds. In that split second of reaching over for a phone, eyes no longer on the road, it is impossible to no an exact location of anything, making an extremely dangerous action. For the myriad of possibilities that lead to serious injury cell phones should stay in the current state they are in regards of the law, but taken as a more serious offense. Conversely people may believe that laws in present need to change, becoming less restrictive. People have the right to communicate with whom they wish, when or wherever they may choose to do so. The problem becomes apparent that this is a selfish process of thought; people aren't thinking of those they share the road with. Laws currently in place are not to punish people making poor choices, they are an attempt to keep people safe. The creation of telecommunication devices was to keep connected to others without regard to the obsession that would encompass the human mind that was bound to follow. The safety of people is top priority without exemption.</td>\n",

The society doesn't understand that teens are the main cause for accidents I mean, in two thousand and five there was three hundred and one thousand injuries that were caused in distracted driving related accidents, that doesn't necessarily mean that the driver was texting or using a cellular device. New drivers do not understand that deaths are usually results of an accident. one out of every four car accidents is caused by texting and driving.  \n",

       "4                                                                                                                                                                        Cell Phone Operation While Driving The ability to stay connected to people we know despite distance was originally brought to fruition by the use of letters. This system was found to be rather slow and new pathways were searched for until the invention of the telegram; the people thought it was an invention of the millennia, but after time it too was thought of as slow until the invention of the telephone. Today, a telephone is in the hand or pocket of a majority of the seven billion people on planet earth. However, this device is taken to areas that it is irresponsible and dangerous. Within a vehicle capable of traveling upwards of one hundred miles per hour any possible distraction can become fatal spontaneously. The most common of these distractions is a cell phone, with its capabilities to connect us to anyone also in ownership of one, it is easy to pick it up whenever it sounds. In that split second of reaching over for a phone, eyes no longer on the road, it is impossible to no an exact location of anything, making an extremely dangerous action. For the myriad of possibilities that lead to serious injury cell phones should stay in the current state they are in regards of the law, but taken as a more serious offense. Conversely people may believe that laws in present need to change, becoming less restrictive. People have the right to communicate with whom they wish, when or wherever they may choose to do so. The problem becomes apparent that this is a selfish process of thought; people aren't thinking of those they share the road with. Laws currently in place are not to punish people making poor choices, they are an attempt to keep people safe. The creation of telecommunication devices was to keep connected to others without regard to the obsession that would encompass the human mind that was bound to follow. The safety of people is top priority without exemption.  "
