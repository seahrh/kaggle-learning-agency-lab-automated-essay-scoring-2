The thing they don't know is that when you use a car alot of thing can happen like you can get in accidet or the smoke that the car has is bad to breath on if someone is walk but in VAUBAN,Germany they dont have that proble because 70 percent of vauban's families do not own cars,and 57 percent sold a car to move there. Street parkig ,driveways and home garages are forbidden on the outskirts of freiburd that near the French and Swiss borders. You probaly won't see a car in Vauban's streets because they are completely \"car free\" but If some that lives in VAUBAN that owns a car ownership is allowed,but there are only two places that you can park a large garages at the edge of the development,where a car owner buys a space but it not cheap to buy one they sell the space for you car for $40,000 along with a home. The vauban people completed this in 2006 ,they said that this an example of a growing trend in Europe,The untile states and some where else are suburban life from auto use this is called \"smart planning\". The current efforts to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions from tailes the passengee cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in some car intensive in the United States. I honeslty think that good idea that they did that is Vaudan because that makes cities denser and better for walking and in VAUBAN there are 5,500 residents within a rectangular square mile. In the artical David Gold berg said that \"All of our development since World war 2 has been centered on the cars,and that will have to change\" and i think that was very true what David Gold said because alot thing we need cars to do we can go anyway were with out cars beacuse some people are a very lazy to walk to place thats why they alot of people use car and i think that it was a good idea that that they did that in VAUBAN so people can see how we really don't need car to go to place from place because we can walk from were we need to go or we can ride bycles with out the use of a car. It good that they are doing that if you thik about your help the earth in way and thats a very good thing to. In the United states ,the Environmental protection Agency is promoting what is called \"car reduced\"communtunties,and the legislators are starting to act,if cautiously. Maany experts expect pubic transport serving suburbs to play a much larger role in a new six years federal transportation bill to approved this year. In previous bill,80 percent of appropriations have by law gone to highways and only 20 percent to other transports. There many good reason why they should do this.</td>\n",

       "      <td>I am a scientist at NASA that is discussing the \"face\" on mars. I will be explaining how the \"face\" is a land form. By sharing my information about this isue i will tell you just that.\\n\\nFirst off, how could it be a martions drawing. There is no plant life on mars as of rite now that we know of, which means so far as we know it is not possible for any type of life. That explains how it could not be made by martians. Also why and how would a martion build a face so big. It just does not make any since that a martian did this.\\n\\nNext, why it is a landform. There are many landforms that are weird here in America, and there is also landforms all around the whole Earth. Many of them look like something we can relate to like a snake a turtle a human... So if there are landforms on earth dont you think landforms are on mars to? Of course! why not? It's just unique that the landform on Mars looks like a human face. Also if there was martians and they were trying to get our attention dont you think we would have saw one by now?\\n\\nFinaly, why you should listen to me. You should listen to me because i am a member of NASA and i've been dealing with all of this stuff that were talking about and people who say martians did this have no relation with NASA and have never worked with anything to relate to this landform. One last thing is that everyone working at NASA says the same thing i say, that the \"face\" is just a landform.\\n\\nTo sum all this up the \"face\" on mars is a landform but others would like to beleive it's a martian sculpture. Which every one that works at NASA says it's a landform and they are all the ones working on the planet and taking pictures.</td>\n",

       "      <td>People always wish they had the same technology that they have seen in movies, or the best new piece of technology that is all over social media. However, nobody seems to think of the risks that these kinds of new technologies may have. Cars have been around for many decades, and now manufacturers are starting to get on the bandwagon and come up with the new and improved technology that they hope will appeal to everyone. As of right now, it seems as though the negative characteristics of these cars consume the positive idea that these manufacturers have tried to convey.\\n\\nCurrently, this new technology in cars has a very long way to go before being completely \"driverless\". Drivers still need to be on alert when they are driving, as well as control the car near any accidents or complicated traffic situations. This seems to totally defeat the purpose of the \"driverless\" car. Eventually the technology may improve, but nobody can be certain that the driverless car will eventually become completely \"driverless\". This idea just seems like a lot of hard work and money for something that is not very neccessary. If someone does not want to drive their car they can just take a city bus or a subway. There are so many options of transportation that can already solve this problem. Even if masnufacturers are trying to make driving more \"fun\", driving is not meant to be \"fun\" it is meant to get people where they need to go. Playing around in a car just to have \"fun\" is just a recipe for disaster.\\n\\nThe idea of the driverless car also raises many questions about who will be liable when someone gets into an accident in one of these new cars. Many states do not even let people drive semi-automatic cars because there are not even laws that pertain to the liability of anyone who get into an accident while driving these type of cars. If these cars become more popular, states may pass new laws. However, this topic also raises questions about who is able to dictate whether or not it was the car or the human's fault for an accident. Since this technology is so new, there could be many problems with the car's system that nobody has even discovered since they have not drove the car themselves. If someone test drives this kind of car or even purchases one and they get into a crash not knowing what could possibly happen to them, they will want to sue the car manufacturer since they were not aware of any bugs in the car's system. These lawsuits can add up and eventually the manufactuers will be in a bunch of debt, which could cost them their whole idea of the driverless car.\\n\\nThe technology car manufacturers are trying to develope may just be a diasaster in the making. There are many alternative options of transportations if you do not feel like driving yourself, and these options are way less expensive than buying a brand new car. Although this technology is relatively new, we can not be certain that this new idea will even pay off in the end, it may just be a waste of money and time. Sometimes the newest technology is not the most benefical.</td>\n",

       "      <td>We all heard about Venus, the planet without almost oxygen with earthquakes, erupting volcanoes and temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit but what if scientist project the futur into this planet ? Through this article, the author uses evidences appealing to reason and concession to make us realize why we should care about studying this planet so that people must give a chance to Venus.\\n\\nVenus is the closest planet to Earth in terms density and size but has a really different climate. As it is evoked by the author:\\n\\n( 3) \"A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus. Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus’s atmosphere. On the planet’s surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit....Beyond high pressure and heat, Venusian geology and weather present additional impediments like erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightning strikes to probes seeking to land on its surface.\" The author uses of concession tell us what is the actual climate of Venus. He tell us the truth, he support the fact that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit but he also recognize that there's a danger present continuously. And because he support the idea of studying Venus, he proposes ways to study the planet and find a solution at a reasonable distance.\\n\\nVenus is an inhospitable planet that can almost be considered as an impossible dwelling for humans. But for the author, that can't keep scientist to do their job (studying Venus) : (5) \"NASA’s possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray. Imagine a blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above the roiling Venusian landscape. Just as our jet airplanes travel at a higher altitude to fly over many storms, a vehicle hovering over Venus would avoid the unfriendly ground conditions by staying up and out of their way. At thirty-plus miles above the surface, temperatures would still be toasty at around 170 degrees Fahrenheit, but the air pressure would be close to that of sea level on Earth.\" Through this evidence, appealing to reasonning, the author talk about the NASA's possible solution to raise his credibility. But also, to convince the audience that we can only find a solution by studying the planet.\\n\\nIn conclusion, despite of Venus hostility put in advance by the concession, the author makes the audience realize that there's a solution but that we can find it only if we study the planet. He make us find out that challenge and curiosity is part of human life. But also that danger and fear should not stop us from discovering new things. After all, we are Humans.</td>\n",

A non-democratic method of selecting a president that ought to be [overruled] by declaring the canaditdate who receives the most populare votes the winner. The advocates of this position are correct in arguing that the Electoral College method is not democratic in a method sense.It is the electors who elect the the president ,not the people. But each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee (and that trust is rarely betrayed).\\n\\nAnother, reason I am in favor of keeping the Electoral College is because, a dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College vote is possible. But it is less likely than a dispute over the popular vote. But it is less likely than a dispute over the popular vote. The reason is that the winning canadate's share of the Electoral College invariably exceeds his share of the popular vote.\\n\\nLast but not least, I am in favor of keeping the Electoral College is because, the Electoral College restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states (by population) lose by virue of the mal apportionment of the Senate decreed in the Constitution. A larger state gets more attintion from presidential canadidates in a campaign than a small state does. It can be argued that Electoral College methods of selecting the president may turn off potential voters for a canadidates who has no hope of carrying their state. But of  course no voter's vote swings a national election, and in spite of that, about 1/2 the eligible American population did vote in the [2012's] election.\\n\\nFrom, PROPER_NAME</td>\n",

The thing they don't know is that when you use a car alot of thing can happen like you can get in accidet or the smoke that the car has is bad to breath on if someone is walk but in VAUBAN,Germany they dont have that proble because 70 percent of vauban's families do not own cars,and 57 percent sold a car to move there. Street parkig ,driveways and home garages are forbidden on the outskirts of freiburd that near the French and Swiss borders. You probaly won't see a car in Vauban's streets because they are completely \"car free\" but If some that lives in VAUBAN that owns a car ownership is allowed,but there are only two places that you can park a large garages at the edge of the development,where a car owner buys a space but it not cheap to buy one they sell the space for you car for $40,000 along with a home. The vauban people completed this in 2006 ,they said that this an example of a growing trend in Europe,The untile states and some where else are suburban life from auto use this is called \"smart planning\". The current efforts to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions from tailes the passengee cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in some car intensive in the United States. I honeslty think that good idea that they did that is Vaudan because that makes cities denser and better for walking and in VAUBAN there are 5,500 residents within a rectangular square mile. In the artical David Gold berg said that \"All of our development since World war 2 has been centered on the cars,and that will have to change\" and i think that was very true what David Gold said because alot thing we need cars to do we can go anyway were with out cars beacuse some people are a very lazy to walk to place thats why they alot of people use car and i think that it was a good idea that that they did that in VAUBAN so people can see how we really don't need car to go to place from place because we can walk from were we need to go or we can ride bycles with out the use of a car. It good that they are doing that if you thik about your help the earth in way and thats a very good thing to. In the United states ,the Environmental protection Agency is promoting what is called \"car reduced\"communtunties,and the legislators are starting to act,if cautiously. Maany experts expect pubic transport serving suburbs to play a much larger role in a new six years federal transportation bill to approved this year. In previous bill,80 percent of appropriations have by law gone to highways and only 20 percent to other transports. There many good reason why they should do this.       \n",

I will be explaining how the \"face\" is a land form. By sharing my information about this isue i will tell you just that.\\n\\nFirst off, how could it be a martions drawing. There is no plant life on mars as of rite now that we know of, which means so far as we know it is not possible for any type of life. That explains how it could not be made by martians. Also why and how would a martion build a face so big. It just does not make any since that a martian did this.\\n\\nNext, why it is a landform. There are many landforms that are weird here in America, and there is also landforms all around the whole Earth. Many of them look like something we can relate to like a snake a turtle a human... So if there are landforms on earth dont you think landforms are on mars to? Of course! why not? It's just unique that the landform on Mars looks like a human face. Also if there was martians and they were trying to get our attention dont you think we would have saw one by now?\\n\\nFinaly, why you should listen to me. You should listen to me because i am a member of NASA and i've been dealing with all of this stuff that were talking about and people who say martians did this have no relation with NASA and have never worked with anything to relate to this landform. One last thing is that everyone working at NASA says the same thing i say, that the \"face\" is just a landform.\\n\\nTo sum all this up the \"face\" on mars is a landform but others would like to beleive it's a martian sculpture. Which every one that works at NASA says it's a landform and they are all the ones working on the planet and taking pictures.   \n",
       "2  People always wish they had the same technology that they have seen in movies, or the best new piece of technology that is all over social media. However, nobody seems to think of the risks that these kinds of new technologies may have. Cars have been around for many decades, and now manufacturers are starting to get on the bandwagon and come up with the new and improved technology that they hope will appeal to everyone. As of right now, it seems as though the negative characteristics of these cars consume the positive idea that these manufacturers have tried to convey.\\n\\nCurrently, this new technology in cars has a very long way to go before being completely \"driverless\". Drivers still need to be on alert when they are driving, as well as control the car near any accidents or complicated traffic situations. This seems to totally defeat the purpose of the \"driverless\" car. Eventually the technology may improve, but nobody can be certain that the driverless car will eventually become completely \"driverless\". This idea just seems like a lot of hard work and money for something that is not very neccessary. If someone does not want to drive their car they can just take a city bus or a subway. There are so many options of transportation that can already solve this problem. Even if masnufacturers are trying to make driving more \"fun\", driving is not meant to be \"fun\" it is meant to get people where they need to go. Playing around in a car just to have \"fun\" is just a recipe for disaster.\\n\\nThe idea of the driverless car also raises many questions about who will be liable when someone gets into an accident in one of these new cars. Many states do not even let people drive semi-automatic cars because there are not even laws that pertain to the liability of anyone who get into an accident while driving these type of cars. If these cars become more popular, states may pass new laws. However, this topic also raises questions about who is able to dictate whether or not it was the car or the human's fault for an accident. Since this technology is so new, there could be many problems with the car's system that nobody has even discovered since they have not drove the car themselves. If someone test drives this kind of car or even purchases one and they get into a crash not knowing what could possibly happen to them, they will want to sue the car manufacturer since they were not aware of any bugs in the car's system. These lawsuits can add up and eventually the manufactuers will be in a bunch of debt, which could cost them their whole idea of the driverless car.\\n\\nThe technology car manufacturers are trying to develope may just be a diasaster in the making. There are many alternative options of transportations if you do not feel like driving yourself, and these options are way less expensive than buying a brand new car. Although this technology is relatively new, we can not be certain that this new idea will even pay off in the end, it may just be a waste of money and time. Sometimes the newest technology is not the most benefical.            \n",

Through this article, the author uses evidences appealing to reason and concession to make us realize why we should care about studying this planet so that people must give a chance to Venus.\\n\\nVenus is the closest planet to Earth in terms density and size but has a really different climate. As it is evoked by the author:\\n\\n( 3) \"A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus. Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus’s atmosphere. On the planet’s surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit....Beyond high pressure and heat, Venusian geology and weather present additional impediments like erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightning strikes to probes seeking to land on its surface.\" The author uses of concession tell us what is the actual climate of Venus. He tell us the truth, he support the fact that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit but he also recognize that there's a danger present continuously. And because he support the idea of studying Venus, he proposes ways to study the planet and find a solution at a reasonable distance.\\n\\nVenus is an inhospitable planet that can almost be considered as an impossible dwelling for humans. But for the author, that can't keep scientist to do their job (studying Venus) : (5) \"NASA’s possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray. Imagine a blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above the roiling Venusian landscape. Just as our jet airplanes travel at a higher altitude to fly over many storms, a vehicle hovering over Venus would avoid the unfriendly ground conditions by staying up and out of their way. At thirty-plus miles above the surface, temperatures would still be toasty at around 170 degrees Fahrenheit, but the air pressure would be close to that of sea level on Earth.\" Through this evidence, appealing to reasonning, the author talk about the NASA's possible solution to raise his credibility. But also, to convince the audience that we can only find a solution by studying the planet.\\n\\nIn conclusion, despite of Venus hostility put in advance by the concession, the author makes the audience realize that there's a solution but that we can find it only if we study the planet. He make us find out that challenge and curiosity is part of human life. But also that danger and fear should not stop us from discovering new things. After all, we are Humans.   \n",

A non-democratic method of selecting a president that ought to be [overruled] by declaring the canaditdate who receives the most populare votes the winner. The advocates of this position are correct in arguing that the Electoral College method is not democratic in a method sense.It is the electors who elect the the president ,not the people. But each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee (and that trust is rarely betrayed).\\n\\nAnother, reason I am in favor of keeping the Electoral College is because, a dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College vote is possible. But it is less likely than a dispute over the popular vote. But it is less likely than a dispute over the popular vote. The reason is that the winning canadate's share of the Electoral College invariably exceeds his share of the popular vote.\\n\\nLast but not least, I am in favor of keeping the Electoral College is because, the Electoral College restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states (by population) lose by virue of the mal apportionment of the Senate decreed in the Constitution. A larger state gets more attintion from presidential canadidates in a campaign than a small state does. It can be argued that Electoral College methods of selecting the president may turn off potential voters for a canadidates who has no hope of carrying their state. But of  course no voter's vote swings a national election, and in spite of that, about 1/2 the eligible American population did vote in the [2012's] election.\\n\\nFrom, PROPER_NAME               \n",

       "      <td>Driverless cars seem like a wonderful idea but produce so many threats that it may not be worth it. In my opinion driverless cars are a mistake. Even though the idea is good, it is not very practical at all. Basically self-driving car manufacturers are asking drivers to trust our lives to sensors and blinking lights.\\n\\nSelf driving cars still rely on humans to take over when things get too difficult. Even though google has been testing automated driving systems since 2009 they still can't use them practically on the roads. What happens when you're sitting down using the heads-up displays meant to keep you busy and you start to drift off? Sure the car has noises and vibrations to wake you up, but some people are heavy sleepers that won't be woken up even by all that commotion. And even if it does wake you up it would have to be a sudden, loud noise or movement and that can induce panic causing the driver to swerve off the road. Then you have crashes, lawsuits, and injury or even death.\\n\\nThat is another point that must be addressed. Who is to blame when the inevitable crashes occur? Is it the driver's fault for trusting in the technology, or is it the manufacturers fault for producing systems that arent perfect enough to trust our lives with. And what about drivers who refuse to trust the systems in the first place? How will the cars react against the human element.\\n\\nMany people are against these self-driving cars and will refuse to trust their lives to robots. Humans are unpredictable and often times don't pay attention to the road, or drive under the influence leaving an element of surprise that the robots have to react to in a split second. And a middle class family or even upper class might be reluctant to spend the money on the cars and systems nescessary to allow for automated driving.\\n\\nSelf-driving cars are not the future. Automobile deaths are decreasing every year as cars get safer and more reliable. There is no reason to introduce a new problem that will just cause more deaths and inevitably end in tradgedy. Humans should not put their lives in the hands of sensors, that's just blind stupidity. The lawsuits, cost, and having to put full trust into a computer should be proof enough.</td>\n",

It is talking about how it Venus was maybe covered with water, and it had maybe contained living things. Another thing is Venus can meet some things that planet Earth has as well, and it's the cloest planet from all the other ones that humans can actully live on. But the author also inculdes how it might be hard to study and get humans on Venus since it has more Carbon in the atmosphere, and also it's more hotter in the plant it self and not able to support anything that lands on it.\\n\\nWhen the author talks about the things that Earth and Venus has in common, like for an example the author talks about how Venus maybe had water. In the text it says, \"Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth.\" Then the author goes on and talks about the things it has on the plant, like in the text it says \" Today, Venus still has some features that are analogous to those on Earth. The planet has a surface of rocky ediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters.\"\\n\\nThen they talk about how they can still explore the planet, is by staying above the atmosphere, even though it might still be cripsy they'll learn more things about the planet it self. In the text it says, \" However, peering at Venus from a ship orbiting or hovering safely far above the planet can provide only limited insight on ground conditions because most forms of light cannot penetrate the dense atmosphere, rendering standard forms of photography and videography ineffective. Most importantly, researchers cannot take samples of rocks, gas, or anything else, from a distance.\"\\n\\nSo therefore scientists are trying to figure out ways we can find things and see if it is able to contain life on planet Venus it self. Also to see if maybe their is water somewhere hidden on the planet still and maybe find life on there.</td>\n",

       "      <td>The author of \"The challenage of exploring Venus ,\" suggests that studying Venus is worthy despite the dangers that are presented. Venus is sometimes called the \"Evening star,\" it's one of the brightest points of light in the night sky. Venus is the second closest planet to the sun, but still a safe distant. It's also not to far away from us, earth.Venus is often referred to as Earth's \"twin.\" It's the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size, and also occasionally closest distant to Earth.\\n\\nEven though Venus hasn't had a spacecraft land in more than three decaddes it's still worth studying. Humans have sent sapacecrafts to land numerous of times, on this cloud-draped world. Each previous mission was unmanned, for a good reason. No spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours. Due to this Venus has a reputation as a challenging planet for humans to study.\\n\\nThere's many reasons to why you couldn't survive on planet Venus. Venus has a thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide, which is very challenging for us. The clouds are even more dangerous because of highly corrosive sulfuric acid. Temperatures average in venus is like 10 times higer than what we are used to. Over 800 dregrees fahrenheit, and also atmosphereic pressure is 90 times greater than what wea re used to on our planet. Venus has the highest tempetures in pur solar system. If were ever to land a spacecraft to Venus, the spacecrat would probably melt.\\n\\nAstronomers are fascinated by venus because longlong ago Venus was the most Earth- like planet. Venus was covered largely with oceans and could have supported in various forms of life. Venus still has some features that are alike Earth. The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and has similar features such as valleys, mountains, and caters. NASA is thinking about sending humans to study Venus.\\n\\nIf humans were to go to Venus they would have to float above the fray. In a blimp like vechile hovering 30 miles above the roiling venusian landscape. Tempetures would still be very toasty at 170 degrees fahrenheit, but tempeture would plentiful, and radiation would not exceed Earth levels. It probably won't be posible to traval to planet Venus.</td>\n",

Imagine having a car that drove for you, that would make people's lives much easier. It would also save a lot of money, Google cofounder Sergey Brin forsees that these driverless cars would use half the fuel today's cars do. Google has had cars that could drive by themselves under specific conditions since 2009. They have driven more than half a million miles without a crash. Think about if everyone got one of these cars, the number of wrecks would decrease dramatically. But as of right now Google cars aren't 100% independent, they still let drivers know when to take over. Tesla has announced a 2016 release for a car that can drive on autopilot 90% of the time. I hate to say it but many of us have seen accidents caused from being under the influence of drugs. If these cars became more popular maybe those numbers will decrease. Some people may disagree with driverless cars but when they could save lives, and minimize the ammount of accidents that happen, im all for it.\\n\\nI believe everyone should get one of these cars.

Driverless cars have always been seen as a thing of the future; however, we are currently living in that future. Car manufacturers are now teaming up with Google to create ways to make cars that require very little human control. Though it may sound innovative and convenient, there are many disadvantages to these new futuristic cars, making them unnecessary.\\n\\nThe first con to manufacturing these cars, is that they are extremely expensive. The amount of sensors, radars, and cameras that would be put into these cars are not cheap or cost-effective. The money that would be put in to this project would have better use going to some type of charity instead. Investing the time and money this type of idea needs, could lead to another project, possibly more beneficial than driverless cars, being neglected.\\n\\nA major problem, that even car makers foresee, is the complication an accident would cause. If there is a collision, and someone is injured and/or killed while the semi-autonomous car is in motion, but the vehicle does not signal the driver to take control, it would be great controversy over who is to blame for the accident. If fault was to be placed on manufacturers, drivers would be inclined to drive more carelessly than they do today because they would have someone to place blame on and walk away without consequence. New laws would have to be made to ensure the safety of the drivers of these cars, and those around them.\\n\\nThe making of these cars also contributes to the laziness and dependence of technology in today's society. Americans have been labeled lackadaisical and the fact that more and more inventions are being made to accommodate our laziness is becoming a growing problem. A simple task such as driving a car is now being handed over to an inanimate object.\\n\\nDriverless cars are a bad idea and should be left to be seen on television, and in books or movies.

The author suggest that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it represents by telling us that NASA is working on approches to study venus without the dangers, and that NASA could allow scientist to \"float above the fray.\"\\n\\nNASA is working on approaches to study venus without the dangers. In \"The Challenge of Exploring Mars\" the author states, \"These devices make calculations by using gears and levers and do not require electronics.\" The \"Mechanical Computers\" could be helpful when studying Venus because it wouldn't be as dangerous if an actual person would go to Venus. The author also states, \"Systems that use mechanical parts can be made more resistant to pressure, heat, and other forces.\" This tells the readers that using the \"Mechanical Computers\" can restrict some of the dangers by using not technology but mechanical wise computers.\\n\\nNASA could possibly work on a blimp- like vehicle hovering over 30 or so miles above the roiling Veusian landscape, states the author. The author states, \"... a vehicle hovering over Venus would avoid the unfriendly ground conditions by staying up and out of their way. \"Using this possible vehicle you could work on studying Venus but also eliminate the risks or dangers you could face in the temperature Venus has. In the passage the author also states, \"At thirty plus miles above the surface, temperatures would still be toasty at around 170 degrees fahrenhit, but the air pressure would be close to that of sea level on earth.\" The author is trying to tell the readers that it would be bad if you just went there without anything instead of easily hovering over venus without the dangers you could face.\\n\\nFurthermore, the author suggests that studying venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it represnts by telling us that NASA is working on approaches to study Venus, and that NASA could allow scientist to float above to fray.

Teachers would have closer bonds with students who are having trouble learning and that would improve test scores and the learning department itself. \"The facial expressions for each emotion are universal.\" is what Dr.Huang said in paragraph 4, which he is right, it could be used in video games, the medical field, schools, and our everyday lives.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Driverless cars are going to make a huge impact on multple people who own one in many positive ways. Nevertheless, driverless cars can possibly impact on people negatively. Therefore, I do not agree with the invention of driverless cars for thr United States.\\n\\nLocated in paragraph one, the positive behind driverless cars is that they use \"half the fuel of today's taxis and off far more flexibilty than a bus.\" Sergey Brin believes that these care will fundamentally make a difference in the world. Another amazing fact is that these cars can drive independently drive themselves more than half a million miles without crashing.\\n\\nLocated in paragraph two, line four, it states that these Google cars are not particularly driverless. These cars appear to alert th driver to take over the car when the car is pulling in and out of driveways. They even alert the driver when dealing with complicating issues with traffic. For example, \"navigating through roadwork or accidents.\" Car accidents can happen in a split second. It may alert you right away, but this will not give you time to turn away or slam the breaks to keep you from being involved in the wreck. If you happen to be involved in an accident, who is to blame?\\n\\nLocated on paragraph nine, line nine, it states \" new laws will be needed in order to cover liability in the case of the accident. If the technology fails and some is injured, who is at fault-the driver or the manufacturer?\" This is a huge problem! Most people now will trust that this car will not wreck, however, if they do get involved in an accident they will blame the manufacturers. Like most large businesses will defend themselves and bring them to court.\\n\\nFinally, what about the teenagers? They go to school and study real hard for their future. The first car they receive is a driverless car. How will this teach young adults to be responsible? How will young adults learn the basics of paying attention to everything on the road and around it? Personally, this whole driverless car invention is sounding a bit lazy and crazy. As a sixteen year old with a drivers permit, I would rather drive on my own then to sit in a driverless car. Driving has helped me to not be completely oblivious in my surroundings. I have learned to pick up some sort of detail in everything. Driving has also helped me with my reflexes. Ina driverless car it doesn't sound too reassuring.\\n\\nDriverless cars can impact many people in many different ways. This invention can save us fundamentally. This invention could lower the car accidents rate. Nevertheless, we the people can do that on our own. We all just need to pay more attention on the road, and to know when or when not to drive. That is definietly one way to save money. Don't believe me?\\n\\nMany people just feel like driving instead of walking. If it is a nice day out and the store is a mile away. I do believe people have the ability to walk. Get out and enjoy. Like I have said before, and I will say it again. Driverless cars can impact many people in many different ways.</td>\n",

Venus is known as the\"Evening Star\".Venus, however is the second planet from our sun.It could be very challenging for us to discover venus because of the acid in the air and how high the temperature can get,consequently one day we'll have a chance to discover what really goes on in Venus.\\n\\nIn \"The challenge of Exploring Venus\", paragraph 4 opens up about how Venus is probably covered with various oceans and could support various forms of life, like earth today. We can find something important in the planet of Venus such as curing any possible diseases, flu's,etc. About 97 percent of carbon dioxide covers Venus,temperatures average to about 800 degrees amd about 90 times greater than what we originally experience.If we can discover the moon with certain risks, then why can't we test out Venus?\\n\\nWe can think of Venus as another challenge we've faced in our lives. Most researchers have been working on innovations that can allow machines to last long enough to get the knowledge we'd need about Venus. If we started the beginning of research now, why would we stop halfway?NASA has been working on some things such as:Simplified electronics made of silicon carbide that has been tested in a chamber simulating venus's surface.So far that electronic has lasted three weeks. Another device they've focused on to help get closer to venus would be mechanical computers, envisioned in the 1800s.The computers can make calculations for gears and levers, although we might have to watch out because in venus the air is acidic which can ruin the mechancial computers.\\n\\nThere are many challenges we are facing all around the would and Venus can be a good start to deciding on whether we'd like to discover some more new things. People in this world are meant to discover new dangers and doubts. We should feel the need to expand our knowledge of imagination and innvoation.</td>\n",

       "      <td>The author supports his main idea very clear on why studying Venus is worth it despite the dangers it presents. The author develops his claim through facts from NASA and facts about Venus. The writer of the story supports it by saying it will gain human curiosity, Venus once has been like Earth, and how electronic devices can melt due to Venus weather.\\n\\nFirst, the author supports the idea of exploring Venus because Venus once been like Earth. In paragraph 4 it states, \" Astronmers are fascinates by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth- like planet in our solar system\". Another example from paragraph 4 is, \" Long ago, Venus was probaly covered largely with oceans and coul have supported various forms of life, just like Earth.\". This illustrates how the author supports the idea of studying Venus because it can show how Venus was once like Earth and to astronomers see what happen to those features. It can show them how Earth was like a long time ago.\\n\\nIn addition, the author supports his idea by telling the readers that it can gain human curiosity. In paragraph 8 the author states, \" Striving to meet the challenge presentrd by Venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors\". Another example from paragraph 4 is \"...doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation\". These examples illustrate how the author supports his idea by saying that exploration to Venus can cause human to wonder how Venus was like. And to see the challenges Venus has despite the dangers that it comes with.\\n\\nLastly, the author talks about how Venus weather is like. He tells the readers that it's a very harsh weather. In paragraph 7 the author states, \" NASA is working on other approaches to studying Venus. For example, some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus's surface and have lasted for three weeks in such conditions\". Another example from paragraph 7 is,\" Just imagine exposing a cell phone or tablet to acid or heat capable of melting tin\". This implifies to the authors support by stating that astrnomers should see what causes that weather and how they can study Venus in a safely matter.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the author supports his idea in various ways. The authors tells the reader how Venus is as its own character. The authors tells the dangers of Venus . The writer showed his support by human curiosity, how Venus climate was, and how it was once made like Earth.</td>\n",

The main thing most people would be worried about is the fact there not really in control of what goes on with the vehicle they purchased. There could be many costly bills, many law suits, for something you didn't do, but what your driverless vehicle did. This could lead to too much then we neen when we could all do what the vehicle is made for, which is for us to drive not to drive by itself.\\n\\nEven though many people have already started investing in the idea for driverless cars, they could be putting themselves in a bigger hole then they thought. The money there putting up could go to waste cause more then likely people would want to drive there own car. This meaning there investing in something that nobody would probleby not want. The big name companies such as Toyata, and Chevy could lose alot of money, when they was making more doing it the normal way. If your in the car driving what you bought you would feel better about your car.\\n\\nThe driverless cars could come with maufunctions that could lead to law suits. Things like your brakes, your steering wheel and even wheels could mess up and you're not there to see who did it or not, cause the car is driverless. Such as if someone was to his your car and the car was messed up, how would you know who did it. Little things like that could change someones whole perspective on the vehicle. Which could make the people take back the car and get a normal one, which means the big name companies would lose money.\\n\\nNot only would we have to wait to even get the car, you would have to be careful with the laws too. Laws such as keeping people focused on the road. Such as if someone hit the car your not driving who would be respansible. If no one was there in either of the cars no one would win the law suit. Many states its already illegal such as California, Nevada, Florida, and Columbia. Once other states realize the damages, they'll change there minds too, and make new laws for cars, Which will make them fustrated and ban cars from many places. In that case if that happens the big name companies will lose a lot of customers and long time assumers, then eventually lose all there money they invested.\\n\\nThis could lead to too much then we neen when we could all do what the vehicle is made for, which is for us to drive not to drive itself. The driverless vehicle is not safe enough to be on streets yet. Nobody would know who's responsible for the mistake of a (driverless car) nondriver. There will be lots of laws banning them and running car buissness down the drain. There would be many things wrong with the routes, such as if there was a car acctident, and the car had to reroute it couldn't. Meaning we should stick to what we have been doing since cars have been first invented, which is driving them ourselves.</td>\n",

It could also be good for a teacher to help teach there students how to do a problem they may not understand the problem. It is a very smart idea that they came up with and I think we should use it and not put it to waste. This could be a very good thing for students and them getting better education.\\n\\nBy bringing this into our schools for students it could help them with there work to help make them understand something better. In the arctle Dr. Hung talks about how if they put this on a computer it could recognize when a students is becoming confused or bored with the problems or with whatever is going on, on the screen. If a math teacher gave you problems to try on the computer over something you just learned that day, your faces that you make while you are doing the work could help the teacher. It could help by letting the teacher know what problems the student made a confused faced on to let the teacher know what to go over with that student. In the article Dr.Hunag also talks about somethimg very simliar to what I said the sentence brefore. In his notes he talked about the computer being like a human instructor. So if you made a confused face while doing a problem instead of letting the teacher know it would just give you easier problems. I think this is the best idea for the use of this new technology. Some students are smarted or learn faster than others so if the computers know that this person is more confused than the others, it could give them easier problems.\\n\\nThink about all the things you can do with this new technology, you do use it to help you with problems on homework or even studing. This is a very useful tool for school and helping kids get a better education and I tink every school should have something like this for there students. If it was in my school I would for sure go and try this new technology to see how cool it really is.</td>\n",

In the passage \"The challenge of exploring Venus\" the author supports the idea that studying Venus will be worth it by telling us all the benefits of why it will be worth it. In the article he says that Venus could have once been like Earth and dried up and had these physical condtions that it has now. The author tries to tell us that exploring Venus will be worth it because it brings valuable research. The author tries to tell us that Venus is a dangerous and difficult planet to explore but with the technology that we have it can be accomplished. The author tries to tell us this by how he describes Venus.\\n\\nIn the passage the author tells us that exploring Venus can bring very valuable information. For example in the passage the author says that Venus could have been like Earth at one point and that fascinates them. In the passage it says \"Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system\", This quote explains why people would like to study this planet because it was like Earth and it could bring valuable information of why it formed this way. In the passage it also says \"Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life just like earth\", This quote gives us another idea why people would want to explore Venus because it can bring information that we have yet to know about. If we get more information about Venus it can help us understand this planet and learn more about it.\\n\\nIn the passage it says that old techonology never made it to Venus but with the new technology that we have we can accomplish we can study venus. In the passage it says that every mission that we have sent to Venus never made it bac because of the harsh conditions that Venus has. In the passage it says \" Each previous mission was unamanned, and for good reason, since no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours\", This quote explains that all the missions that we have sent to Venus never made it back because of the technology that we sent out there. In the passage it says that overtime we have created technology that is capable of withstanding Venus conditions. In the passage the author says \"For example, some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venu's surface and have lasted for three weeks in such conditions.\", This quote explains how our technology has improved and that now we have a\\n\\nmore likely chance to study Venus and get to learn more about it.\\n\\nTo conclude, the author suggests that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit because it will bring valuable information and we have the technology to ecplore Venus. Venus was like Earth and astronomers are working on getting us to learn more about it. Astronomers over time have sent numerous missions to Venus but none of them ever made it back but now with the technology that we have our missions have a chance of succeding.

In my opinion driverless cars are a mistake. Even though the idea is good, it is not very practical at all. Basically self-driving car manufacturers are asking drivers to trust our lives to sensors and blinking lights.\\n\\nSelf driving cars still rely on humans to take over when things get too difficult. Even though google has been testing automated driving systems since 2009 they still can't use them practically on the roads. What happens when you're sitting down using the heads-up displays meant to keep you busy and you start to drift off? Sure the car has noises and vibrations to wake you up, but some people are heavy sleepers that won't be woken up even by all that commotion. And even if it does wake you up it would have to be a sudden, loud noise or movement and that can induce panic causing the driver to swerve off the road. Then you have crashes, lawsuits, and injury or even death.\\n\\nThat is another point that must be addressed. Who is to blame when the inevitable crashes occur? Is it the driver's fault for trusting in the technology, or is it the manufacturers fault for producing systems that arent perfect enough to trust our lives with. And what about drivers who refuse to trust the systems in the first place? How will the cars react against the human element.\\n\\nMany people are against these self-driving cars and will refuse to trust their lives to robots. Humans are unpredictable and often times don't pay attention to the road, or drive under the influence leaving an element of surprise that the robots have to react to in a split second. And a middle class family or even upper class might be reluctant to spend the money on the cars and systems nescessary to allow for automated driving.\\n\\nSelf-driving cars are not the future. Automobile deaths are decreasing every year as cars get safer and more reliable. There is no reason to introduce a new problem that will just cause more deaths and inevitably end in tradgedy. Humans should not put their lives in the hands of sensors, that's just blind stupidity. The lawsuits, cost, and having to put full trust into a computer should be proof enough.   \n",

It is talking about how it Venus was maybe covered with water, and it had maybe contained living things. Another thing is Venus can meet some things that planet Earth has as well, and it's the cloest planet from all the other ones that humans can actully live on. But the author also inculdes how it might be hard to study and get humans on Venus since it has more Carbon in the atmosphere, and also it's more hotter in the plant it self and not able to support anything that lands on it.\\n\\nWhen the author talks about the things that Earth and Venus has in common, like for an example the author talks about how Venus maybe had water. In the text it says, \"Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth.\" Then the author goes on and talks about the things it has on the plant, like in the text it says \" Today, Venus still has some features that are analogous to those on Earth. The planet has a surface of rocky ediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters.\"\\n\\nThen they talk about how they can still explore the planet, is by staying above the atmosphere, even though it might still be cripsy they'll learn more things about the planet it self. In the text it says, \" However, peering at Venus from a ship orbiting or hovering safely far above the planet can provide only limited insight on ground conditions because most forms of light cannot penetrate the dense atmosphere, rendering standard forms of photography and videography ineffective. Most importantly, researchers cannot take samples of rocks, gas, or anything else, from a distance.\"\\n\\nSo therefore scientists are trying to figure out ways we can find things and see if it is able to contain life on planet Venus it self. Also to see if maybe their is water somewhere hidden on the planet still and maybe find life on there.    \n",

Venus is sometimes called the \"Evening star,\" it's one of the brightest points of light in the night sky. Venus is the second closest planet to the sun, but still a safe distant. It's also not to far away from us, earth.Venus is often referred to as Earth's \"twin.\" It's the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size, and also occasionally closest distant to Earth.\\n\\nEven though Venus hasn't had a spacecraft land in more than three decaddes it's still worth studying. Humans have sent sapacecrafts to land numerous of times, on this cloud-draped world. Each previous mission was unmanned, for a good reason. No spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours. Due to this Venus has a reputation as a challenging planet for humans to study.\\n\\nThere's many reasons to why you couldn't survive on planet Venus. Venus has a thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide, which is very challenging for us. The clouds are even more dangerous because of highly corrosive sulfuric acid. Temperatures average in venus is like 10 times higer than what we are used to. Over 800 dregrees fahrenheit, and also atmosphereic pressure is 90 times greater than what wea re used to on our planet. Venus has the highest tempetures in pur solar system. If were ever to land a spacecraft to Venus, the spacecrat would probably melt.\\n\\nAstronomers are fascinated by venus because longlong ago Venus was the most Earth- like planet. Venus was covered largely with oceans and could have supported in various forms of life. Venus still has some features that are alike Earth. The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and has similar features such as valleys, mountains, and caters. NASA is thinking about sending humans to study Venus.\\n\\nIf humans were to go to Venus they would have to float above the fray. In a blimp like vechile hovering 30 miles above the roiling venusian landscape. Tempetures would still be very toasty at 170 degrees fahrenheit, but tempeture would plentiful, and radiation would not exceed Earth levels. It probably won't be posible to traval to planet Venus.     \n",

Table-tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling,and games also helped pass the time.That is why you should become a seagoing cowboy that rides the waves. The other reasons why you should be a seagoing cowboy is because you get to see new oceans.You also get to se other islands that you never seen before.Being a seagoing cowboy helps you get more aware of how other people need help to. The text states it made me more aware of people of other countries and his family to host a numbeer of international students and ,exchange visitors for many years. When you are a seagoing cowboy you get sail on a boat alote.The other reason why you should become a seagoing cowboy is because when you are a seagoing cowboy,you can make people lives better by helping them.Getting to be a seagoing cowboy helps you change it makes, you want to do better things for other people.The text states he knew it was an opportunity of a life time.   \n",

Why not study it it use to be like earth. and also it a star you see at night.\\n\\nVenus is one of the most intresting planets near earth I think it would be intresting to study and so does NASA the text says, \"NASA is working on othe approaches to study Venus for example, some simplified electronics mode of silicon carbide have bee tested in a chamber simualting the chaos of venus's surface and have lasted 3 weeks in such conditions\". See we could try and study Venus we could be on there for a 2 weeks and leave.\\n\\nVenus is called the sister planet because of how close it is and like family Venus has the same looks aswhille the text says, \"Venus still has some features that are analogous to those on earth. The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters\". See if Venus is like earth we could look at what happened to it and make sure that doesn't happened to us.\\n\\nVenus is a star we see at night have you ever wonder what it was? Or how it's like earth and has no life that is what NASA and so\\n\\nmany more space programs are trying to find out.\\n\\nI think that the author is right that we should go study Venus even if it dangerus it's worthy of that risk. it a star and planet in our solar system. Venus is our sister planet and looks like us too, and NASA is finding ways for us to be able to walk on Venus and study it aswhile.    \n",

They are used everyday by everyone, and are one of the leading causes of death in this world. Driverless cars seem to be a great alternative to driving.\\n\\nPeople travel every day whether that be to work, school, or the grocery store, they are always traveling. Imagine having a car that drove for you, that would make people's lives much easier. It would also save a lot of money, Google cofounder Sergey Brin forsees that these driverless cars would use half the fuel today's cars do. Google has had cars that could drive by themselves under specific conditions since 2009. They have driven more than half a million miles without a crash. Think about if everyone got one of these cars, the number of wrecks would decrease dramatically. But as of right now Google cars aren't 100% independent, they still let drivers know when to take over. Tesla has announced a 2016 release for a car that can drive on autopilot 90% of the time. I hate to say it but many of us have seen accidents caused from being under the influence of drugs. If these cars became more popular maybe those numbers will decrease. Some people may disagree with driverless cars but when they could save lives, and minimize the ammount of accidents that happen, im all for it.\\n\\nI believe everyone should get one of these cars. They will cause less accidents, and be cleaner for the enviorment because they are not using up as much gas. Driverless cars will someday be the new alternative to driving.    \n",

Driverless cars have always been seen as a thing of the future; however, we are currently living in that future. Car manufacturers are now teaming up with Google to create ways to make cars that require very little human control. Though it may sound innovative and convenient, there are many disadvantages to these new futuristic cars, making them unnecessary.\\n\\nThe first con to manufacturing these cars, is that they are extremely expensive. The amount of sensors, radars, and cameras that would be put into these cars are not cheap or cost-effective. The money that would be put in to this project would have better use going to some type of charity instead. Investing the time and money this type of idea needs, could lead to another project, possibly more beneficial than driverless cars, being neglected.\\n\\nA major problem, that even car makers foresee, is the complication an accident would cause. If there is a collision, and someone is injured and/or killed while the semi-autonomous car is in motion, but the vehicle does not signal the driver to take control, it would be great controversy over who is to blame for the accident. If fault was to be placed on manufacturers, drivers would be inclined to drive more carelessly than they do today because they would have someone to place blame on and walk away without consequence. New laws would have to be made to ensure the safety of the drivers of these cars, and those around them.\\n\\nThe making of these cars also contributes to the laziness and dependence of technology in today's society. Americans have been labeled lackadaisical and the fact that more and more inventions are being made to accommodate our laziness is becoming a growing problem. A simple task such as driving a car is now being handed over to an inanimate object.\\n\\nDriverless cars are a bad idea and should be left to be seen on television, and in books or movies. The risk factors and societal damage these cars would cause, greatly reigns over the benefits car manufacturers think the cars have.   \n",

The author tells us the temperature average is over 800 degrees fahrenheit and the atmospheric pressure over 90 times greater that what we are used to on earth! Venus has the hottest surface planet temperature of any planet despite Mercury being the closest to the sun. The author suggest that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it represents by telling us that NASA is working on approches to study venus without the dangers, and that NASA could allow scientist to \"float above the fray.\"\\n\\nNASA is working on approaches to study venus without the dangers. In \"The Challenge of Exploring Mars\" the author states, \"These devices make calculations by using gears and levers and do not require electronics.\" The \"Mechanical Computers\" could be helpful when studying Venus because it wouldn't be as dangerous if an actual person would go to Venus. The author also states, \"Systems that use mechanical parts can be made more resistant to pressure, heat, and other forces.\" This tells the readers that using the \"Mechanical Computers\" can restrict some of the dangers by using not technology but mechanical wise computers.\\n\\nNASA could possibly work on a blimp- like vehicle hovering over 30 or so miles above the roiling Veusian landscape, states the author. The author states, \"... a vehicle hovering over Venus would avoid the unfriendly ground conditions by staying up and out of their way. \"Using this possible vehicle you could work on studying Venus but also eliminate the risks or dangers you could face in the temperature Venus has. In the passage the author also states, \"At thirty plus miles above the surface, temperatures would still be toasty at around 170 degrees fahrenhit, but the air pressure would be close to that of sea level on earth.\" The author is trying to tell the readers that it would be bad if you just went there without anything instead of easily hovering over venus without the dangers you could face.\\n\\nFurthermore, the author suggests that studying venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it represnts by telling us that NASA is working on approaches to study Venus, and that NASA could allow scientist to float above to fray. Studying Venus would be something that hasn't been done in more than 3 decades and coming up with something that could avoid the Venus dangers would be a miracle.           \n",

Then that computer being able to take that data and improve your learning experiance at school. Well based off of Dr.Huang's research collaboratrion with Prof. Nicu Sebe from the University of Amsterdam, that might happen soon. They were able to find out the Mona Lisa's facial expression using a brand new computer software from Prof. Thomas Huang.\\n\\nIt is said in paragraph 1 \"Dr.Huang and his colleague are experts at developing better ways for humans and computers to communicate.\" Which is great news.\\n\\nThis Is great news for schools because; it will make learner better for students who are having trouble in class. According to Dr. Huang in paragraph 6 he pridicts; \"A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or boared, Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor.\" This could also help with non verbal communication, and emotional communication. Shy students wouldnt have to be quiet and have unanswerd questions if we brought this technology into schools.\\n\\nIn conclussion, this technology would be a major break throug in class rooms and the world itself. Teachers would have closer bonds with students who are having trouble learning and that would improve test scores and the learning department itself. \"The facial expressions for each emotion are universal.\" is what Dr.Huang said in paragraph 4, which he is right, it could be used in video games, the medical field, schools, and our everyday lives.          \n",

Nevertheless, driverless cars can possibly impact on people negatively. Therefore, I do not agree with the invention of driverless cars for thr United States.\\n\\nLocated in paragraph one, the positive behind driverless cars is that they use \"half the fuel of today's taxis and off far more flexibilty than a bus.\" Sergey Brin believes that these care will fundamentally make a difference in the world. Another amazing fact is that these cars can drive independently drive themselves more than half a million miles without crashing.\\n\\nLocated in paragraph two, line four, it states that these Google cars are not particularly driverless. These cars appear to alert th driver to take over the car when the car is pulling in and out of driveways. They even alert the driver when dealing with complicating issues with traffic. For example, \"navigating through roadwork or accidents.\" Car accidents can happen in a split second. It may alert you right away, but this will not give you time to turn away or slam the breaks to keep you from being involved in the wreck. If you happen to be involved in an accident, who is to blame?\\n\\nLocated on paragraph nine, line nine, it states \" new laws will be needed in order to cover liability in the case of the accident. If the technology fails and some is injured, who is at fault-the driver or the manufacturer?\" This is a huge problem! Most people now will trust that this car will not wreck, however, if they do get involved in an accident they will blame the manufacturers. Like most large businesses will defend themselves and bring them to court.\\n\\nFinally, what about the teenagers? They go to school and study real hard for their future. The first car they receive is a driverless car. How will this teach young adults to be responsible? How will young adults learn the basics of paying attention to everything on the road and around it? Personally, this whole driverless car invention is sounding a bit lazy and crazy. As a sixteen year old with a drivers permit, I would rather drive on my own then to sit in a driverless car. Driving has helped me to not be completely oblivious in my surroundings. I have learned to pick up some sort of detail in everything. Driving has also helped me with my reflexes. Ina driverless car it doesn't sound too reassuring.\\n\\nDriverless cars can impact many people in many different ways. This invention can save us fundamentally. This invention could lower the car accidents rate. Nevertheless, we the people can do that on our own. We all just need to pay more attention on the road, and to know when or when not to drive. That is definietly one way to save money. Don't believe me?\\n\\nMany people just feel like driving instead of walking. If it is a nice day out and the store is a mile away. I do believe people have the ability to walk. Get out and enjoy. Like I have said before, and I will say it again. Driverless cars can impact many people in many different ways.    \n",

He was working two part time jobs at the grocrey store and the bank and. It was a opportunity of a life time so he had to take it his life was just begning When his freind wanted him to join.He was only 18 whe he was drafted to be a seagoing cowboy.\\n\\nLuke also made fun aboard with when they unloaded they played fun games like. Baseball, Volleyball ,Table Tennis tournements , Fencing , Boxing , Reading, Whittiling and alot more.But they also had hard work to do like the dangers of the sea. One day luke was night watchman he had to check on all animals every hour one night he fell and almost landed in the sea but he cought.

Venus is known as the\"Evening Star\".Venus, however is the second planet from our sun.It could be very challenging for us to discover venus because of the acid in the air and how high the temperature can get,consequently one day we'll have a chance to discover what really goes on in Venus.\\n\\nIn \"The challenge of Exploring Venus\", paragraph 4 opens up about how Venus is probably covered with various oceans and could support various forms of life, like earth today. We can find something important in the planet of Venus such as curing any possible diseases, flu's,etc. About 97 percent of carbon dioxide covers Venus,temperatures average to about 800 degrees amd about 90 times greater than what we originally experience.If we can discover the moon with certain risks, then why can't we test out Venus?\\n\\nWe can think of Venus as another challenge we've faced in our lives. Most researchers have been working on innovations that can allow machines to last long enough to get the knowledge we'd need about Venus. If we started the beginning of research now, why would we stop halfway?NASA has been working on some things such as:Simplified electronics made of silicon carbide that has been tested in a chamber simulating venus's surface.So far that electronic has lasted three weeks. Another device they've focused on to help get closer to venus would be mechanical computers, envisioned in the 1800s.The computers can make calculations for gears and levers, although we might have to watch out because in venus the air is acidic which can ruin the mechancial computers.\\n\\nThere are many challenges we are facing all around the would and Venus can be a good start to deciding on whether we'd like to discover some more new things. People in this world are meant to discover new dangers and doubts. We should feel the need to expand our knowledge of imagination and innvoation.   \n",

The author develops his claim through facts from NASA and facts about Venus. The writer of the story supports it by saying it will gain human curiosity, Venus once has been like Earth, and how electronic devices can melt due to Venus weather.\\n\\nFirst, the author supports the idea of exploring Venus because Venus once been like Earth. In paragraph 4 it states, \" Astronmers are fascinates by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth- like planet in our solar system\". Another example from paragraph 4 is, \" Long ago, Venus was probaly covered largely with oceans and coul have supported various forms of life, just like Earth.\". This illustrates how the author supports the idea of studying Venus because it can show how Venus was once like Earth and to astronomers see what happen to those features. It can show them how Earth was like a long time ago.\\n\\nIn addition, the author supports his idea by telling the readers that it can gain human curiosity. In paragraph 8 the author states, \" Striving to meet the challenge presentrd by Venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors\". Another example from paragraph 4 is \"...doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation\". These examples illustrate how the author supports his idea by saying that exploration to Venus can cause human to wonder how Venus was like. And to see the challenges Venus has despite the dangers that it comes with.\\n\\nLastly, the author talks about how Venus weather is like. He tells the readers that it's a very harsh weather. In paragraph 7 the author states, \" NASA is working on other approaches to studying Venus. For example, some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus's surface and have lasted for three weeks in such conditions\". Another example from paragraph 7 is,\" Just imagine exposing a cell phone or tablet to acid or heat capable of melting tin\". This implifies to the authors support by stating that astrnomers should see what causes that weather and how they can study Venus in a safely matter.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the author supports his idea in various ways. The authors tells the reader how Venus is as its own character. The authors tells the dangers of Venus . The writer showed his support by human curiosity, how Venus climate was, and how it was once made like Earth.       \n",

Driverless cars are way to damngerous, and could take up a lot of money. The main thing most people would be worried about is the fact there not really in control of what goes on with the vehicle they purchased. There could be many costly bills, many law suits, for something you didn't do, but what your driverless vehicle did. This could lead to too much then we neen when we could all do what the vehicle is made for, which is for us to drive not to drive by itself.\\n\\nEven though many people have already started investing in the idea for driverless cars, they could be putting themselves in a bigger hole then they thought. The money there putting up could go to waste cause more then likely people would want to drive there own car. This meaning there investing in something that nobody would probleby not want. The big name companies such as Toyata, and Chevy could lose alot of money, when they was making more doing it the normal way. If your in the car driving what you bought you would feel better about your car.\\n\\nThe driverless cars could come with maufunctions that could lead to law suits. Things like your brakes, your steering wheel and even wheels could mess up and you're not there to see who did it or not, cause the car is driverless. Such as if someone was to his your car and the car was messed up, how would you know who did it. Little things like that could change someones whole perspective on the vehicle. Which could make the people take back the car and get a normal one, which means the big name companies would lose money.\\n\\nNot only would we have to wait to even get the car, you would have to be careful with the laws too. Laws such as keeping people focused on the road. Such as if someone hit the car your not driving who would be respansible. If no one was there in either of the cars no one would win the law suit. Many states its already illegal such as California, Nevada, Florida, and Columbia. Once other states realize the damages, they'll change there minds too, and make new laws for cars, Which will make them fustrated and ban cars from many places. In that case if that happens the big name companies will lose a lot of customers and long time assumers, then eventually lose all there money they invested.\\n\\nThis could lead to too much then we neen when we could all do what the vehicle is made for, which is for us to drive not to drive itself. The driverless vehicle is not safe enough to be on streets yet. Nobody would know who's responsible for the mistake of a (driverless car) nondriver. There will be lots of laws banning them and running car buissness down the drain. There would be many things wrong with the routes, such as if there was a car acctident, and the car had to reroute it couldn't. Meaning we should stick to what we have been doing since cars have been first invented, which is driving them ourselves.   \n",

It was help the students with projects or even there work. It could also be good for a teacher to help teach there students how to do a problem they may not understand the problem. It is a very smart idea that they came up with and I think we should use it and not put it to waste. This could be a very good thing for students and them getting better education.\\n\\nBy bringing this into our schools for students it could help them with there work to help make them understand something better. In the arctle Dr. Hung talks about how if they put this on a computer it could recognize when a students is becoming confused or bored with the problems or with whatever is going on, on the screen. If a math teacher gave you problems to try on the computer over something you just learned that day, your faces that you make while you are doing the work could help the teacher. It could help by letting the teacher know what problems the student made a confused faced on to let the teacher know what to go over with that student. In the article Dr.Hunag also talks about somethimg very simliar to what I said the sentence brefore. In his notes he talked about the computer being like a human instructor. So if you made a confused face while doing a problem instead of letting the teacher know it would just give you easier problems. I think this is the best idea for the use of this new technology. Some students are smarted or learn faster than others so if the computers know that this person is more confused than the others, it could give them easier problems.\\n\\nThink about all the things you can do with this new technology, you do use it to help you with problems on homework or even studing. This is a very useful tool for school and helping kids get a better education and I tink every school should have something like this for there students. If it was in my school I would for sure go and try this new technology to see how cool it really is.   \n",
       "4355  People have been curious to learn about Venus for decades and now we have a chance to learn more about it. In the passage \"The challenge of exploring Venus\" the author supports the idea that studying Venus will be worth it by telling us all the benefits of why it will be worth it. In the article he says that Venus could have once been like Earth and dried up and had these physical condtions that it has now. The author tries to tell us that exploring Venus will be worth it because it brings valuable research. The author tries to tell us that Venus is a dangerous and difficult planet to explore but with the technology that we have it can be accomplished. The author tries to tell us this by how he describes Venus.\\n\\nIn the passage the author tells us that exploring Venus can bring very valuable information. For example in the passage the author says that Venus could have been like Earth at one point and that fascinates them. In the passage it says \"Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system\", This quote explains why people would like to study this planet because it was like Earth and it could bring valuable information of why it formed this way. In the passage it also says \"Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life just like earth\", This quote gives us another idea why people would want to explore Venus because it can bring information that we have yet to know about. If we get more information about Venus it can help us understand this planet and learn more about it.\\n\\nIn the passage it says that old techonology never made it to Venus but with the new technology that we have we can accomplish we can study venus. In the passage it says that every mission that we have sent to Venus never made it bac because of the harsh conditions that Venus has. In the passage it says \" Each previous mission was unamanned, and for good reason, since no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours\", This quote explains that all the missions that we have sent to Venus never made it back because of the technology that we sent out there. In the passage it says that overtime we have created technology that is capable of withstanding Venus conditions. In the passage the author says \"For example, some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venu's surface and have lasted for three weeks in such conditions.\", This quote explains how our technology has improved and that now we have a\\n\\nmore likely chance to study Venus and get to learn more about it.\\n\\nTo conclude, the author suggests that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit because it will bring valuable information and we have the technology to ecplore Venus. Venus was like Earth and astronomers are working on getting us to learn more about it. Astronomers over time have sent numerous missions to Venus but none of them ever made it back but now with the technology that we have our missions have a chance of succeding. The author is fascinated on learning about this planet because it can help us understand why this planet is how it is is now.                           \n",

This means that you are a face craving. The text states that \"A few days later NASA unveiled the image for all to see. The caption noted a \"huge rock infomation...which resembles a huan head...formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, noes, and mouth.\" The authors reasoned it would be a good way to engage the public and attract attention to Mars. This means that thay have found some evidence of the face craving in the moon. The text states that \"Nevertheless, on April 8, 2001-a cloudless summer day in Cydonia- Mars Global Surveyor drew close enough for a second look. \"We had aroll the spacecraft 25 degress to center the Face in the field of view,\" said Garvin. \"Malin's team captured an extraorinary photo using\\n\\nthe camera's absolute maximum resolution.\" Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best1976 Viking photo. This means that he took a photo with camera to show that he had proff. Conclusion is that he finially had found what was the face look like.   \n",

The author mostley stated the bad things about studying Venus and very few positive things.\\n\\nThe author states \"Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system\". This statement supports his idea but not good enough. \"Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation\" says the author. I love this comment, but he does not eplain why he thinks this.\\n\\nWhen I read this I disagree with the author because he puts a lot of negative information into\\n\\nthe aticle. \"Each previous mission was unmanned, and for good reason, since no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours\" this tells us that if we wee to try this mission again we wouldn't survive, and if you add on \"These conditions are far more extreme than anything humans encounter on Earth\" this is telling us we would not be able to handle it because we have never incountered such temperatures and and dangerouse acids.\\n\\nThe author of \"Challenge of Exploring Venus\" should have put more positive information into his article rather than putting a lot of negativity. The author's article was detailed and provided a lot of information, but not enough to back up his suggestion to study Venus.      \n",
